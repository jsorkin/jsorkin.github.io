<h1>THE ILLUMINATI IS REAL</h1>

<p>THE QUETZAL IS A BIRD NATIVE TO GUATAMALA, AND IT IS CONSIDERED VERY SACRED. THERE IS A LONG LEGEND ABOUT HOW IT CAME TO BE, AND I BELIEVE THAT QUETZALS ARE PART OF THE ILLUMINATI. THEIR HAIR IS VERY SPIKEY AND CRAZY, JUST LIKE A SILKIE CHICKEN'S. THIS IS BECAUSE AFTER BECOMING A BIRD, QUETZAL FLEW TO CHINA TO EXPAND THE ILLUMINATI'S RULE. THERE, HE BECAME A CHICKEN AND BECAME INDEGINOUS, AND SECRETLY INFLUINCING ALL THE LEADERS IDEAS. THE ILLUMINATI WILL SOON TAKE OVER THE WORLD!!!! RUN FOR YOUR LI---everything is fine. Do not panic. Sincerely, not the Quetzal. P.S. I'm totally not a quetzal.</p>
