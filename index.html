<h1>THE ILLUMINATI IS REAL</h1>

<p>THE QUETZAL IS A BIRD NATIVE TO GUATAMALA, AND IT IS CONSIDERED VERY SACRED. THERE IS A LONG LEGEND ABOUT HOW IT CAME TO BE,</p>

<p id="crazy">AND I BELIEVE THAT QUETZALS ARE PART OF THE ILLUMINATI. THEIR HAIR IS VERY SPIKEY AND CRAZY, JUST LIKE A SILKIE CHICKEN'S. THIS IS BECAUSE AFTER BECOMING A BIRD, QUETZAL FLEW TO CHINA TO EXPAND THE ILLUMINATI'S RULE. THERE, HE BECAME A CHICKEN AND BECAME INDEGINOUS, AND SECRETLY INFLUINCING ALL THE LEADERS IDEAS. ALSO, THEY RECENTLY CAME TO AMERICA! LOOK AT DONALD TRUMP AND HIS HAIR! THE ILLUMINATI WILL SOON TAKE OVER THE WORLD!!!! RUN FOR YOUR LI---everything is fine. Do not panic. Sincerely, not the Quetzal. P.S. I'm totally not a quetzal.</p>
